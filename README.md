Dissertation title:
Paleoclimate change: How varying the mantle dynamics in an isolated thermal regime can affect the climate of a supercontinental Earth

Abstract:
Through the Theory of Plate Tectonics, supercontinents have long been theorised to have occurred on Earth. Not only this, but their periodic assembly and breakup have long term effects on not only the shape of the Earth, but on its climate. Using ASPECT, the Advanced Solver for Planetary Evolution, Convection, and Tectonics, six factors were assessed for their impact on mantle temperatures at the base of the continental lithosphere. These six factors were: model lateral extent, oceanic crust convection speed, oceanic crust convection direction, mantle internal starting temperature, continental crust internal heat production, and continental crust thickness. The results suggest that the oceanic crust convection speed and direction have the greatest impact on subcontinental mantle temperatures, followed by the model lateral extent and mantle internal starting temperature. Where model lateral extent analysis also showed that a minimum model lateral extent larger than 7500km should be used if a vertical extent of 3000km is used, as continental crust is too small. The continental crust internal heat production and thickness were the least influential, both producing the coolest and smallest range of average subcontinental mantle temperatures of the factors tested.
