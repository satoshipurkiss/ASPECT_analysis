Dissertation title:
Paleoclimate change: How Varying the Mantle Dynamics in an Isolated Thermal Regime can affect the Climate of a Supercontinental Earth

Abstract:
Through the Theory of Plate Tectonics, supercontinents have long been theorised to have occurred on Earth. Not only this, but their periodic assembly and breakup have had long term effects on not only the shape of the Earth, but on its climate. Using ASPECT, the Advanced Solver for Planetary Evolution, Convection, and Tectonics, six parameters were assessed for their impact on mantle temperatures at the base of the continental lithosphere. This subcontinental mantle temperature was used to qualitatively assess the level of volcanism that would occur, and in turn the effect on the climate. These six parameters were: model lateral extent, oceanic crust convection speed, oceanic crust convection direction, mantle internal starting temperature, continental crust internal heat production, and continental crust thickness. The results suggest that the oceanic crust convection speed and direction have the greatest impact on subcontinental mantle temperatures, followed by the model lateral extent and mantle internal starting temperature. Analysis also showed that to accurately model the system, a model lateral extent larger than 7500km should be used if a vertical extent of 3000km is assumed. The continental crust internal heat production and thickness were the least influential, both producing the coolest and smallest range of average subcontinental mantle temperatures of the parameters tested.
